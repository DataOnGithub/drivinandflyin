This is a hack I initially did at BoilerMake Spring 2014 at Purdue University.
I've worked on it since, and it featurecreeped to do the following:

* Based on your location, looks up airports that you might be heading towards
* Show your location on a map
* When an airport is within 50 miles, monitors that airport for closure messages
* When an airport is within 35 miles, displays detailed flight information like you'd see on the screens in the terminal: airline, flight number, city arriving from, city departing to, scheduled time, on-time status, gate number, and if it's available, baggage claim carousel number.
* Real time traffic information, used to calculate your ETA at each airport

I live in Madison WI; around here it's very common to fly out of Milwaukee WI, Chicago O'Hare, Chicago Midway, or even Rockford IL. Weather here can change drastically between here and whichever airport you're headed for. So--if you're headed to an airport to pick someone up, or to fly out yourself, you don't have to mess around with three different apps. Just keep Drivin' and Flyin' up on your device and you'll get the information you need on the way to the airport. whichever airport you decide to use.
